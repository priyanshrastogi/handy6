            <h3>Demonstration</h3>
            <p>User can log into the application using appropriate credentials.</p>
            <img src="images/login.PNG" class="img-responsive" alt="Login Screen">
            <p><br>Now this dashboard screen opens up. User can select any operation i.e. Setup Hadoop/Hadoop2, See Cluster Status, Manage Docker Containers, Setup Web Server etc.</p>
            <img src="images/dashboard.PNG" class="img-responsive" alt="Dashboard Screen">
            <p><br>If user selects 'Setup Hadoop', this screen opens up. Now there are two options to setup hadoop cluster. Manual and On-demand.
            In Manual, after entering number of datanodes, user will be asked IP addresses of namenode, jobtracker, client and all datanodes. Now this application will automatically install and
            setup hadoop on all the systems. In On-demand, user don't need to enter IP addresses of any server. This application will make docker containers for namenode, jobtracker, client,
            and all of the datanodes and configure hadoop in them.</p>
            <img src="images/hadoop.PNG" class="img-responsive" alt="Config Hadoop Screen">
            <p><br>When hadoop cluster setup is done, this screen opens up and shows Namspace ID of your hadoop cluster.</p>
            <img src="images/success.PNG" class="img-responsive" alt="Success Screen">
            <p><br>In this page, User can upload datasets and select the operation, user wants to perform on the dataset. If user wants to do employee satisfaction analysis (s)he can select the operation in the dropdown.
            Currently, there are four operations, as mentioned above in features. Here we have selected employee satisfaction analysis. This hrdata.csv file contains
            satisfaction score, salary type, experience, number of projects, job data of 14999 employees.</p>
            <img src="images/upload.PNG" class="img-responsive" alt="Upload and Analyse Screen">
            <p><br>When analysis is done in MapReduce, Aplication fatches results from Hadoop File System and shows it right in the browser.</p>
            <img src="images/data-success.PNG" class="img-responsive" alt="Data Success Screen">
            <p><br>Add-on Utility #1: Manage Docker Containers page, User can manage all the docker containers running on server, User can add, delete, start, stop containers right from the browser.</p>
            <img src="images/docker.PNG" class="img-responsive" alt="Manage Docker Screen">
            <p><br>Add-on Utility #2: Enter IP address and password of a system and make it a webserver. HANDY 6 automatically installs and configures httpd server on the system.</p>
